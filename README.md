Portal_Protector
================

The source files and .jar for my minecraft Bukkit Plugin: Portal Protector

The main purpose of this plugin is to stop griefing and portal spawn-killing in Minecraft servers, as I personally
believe that it is unfair to kill a player the moment they spawn in a portal, while their computer is still buffering
the Nether/Overworld and therefore unable to respond well to user commands. For more information including the full
effects of this plugin go to http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/portalprotector/
